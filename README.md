# Transit App 

Its a Transit app application. It is designed to serve for custom requirements as part of Assignment 3.

## Usage and Features

    - On launch, a map is displayed, overlaid with indicators showing the current positions of all
    or selected buses.
    - The marker for each bus includes the route number.
    - The positions of the buses are updated approximately every 15 seconds.
    - The user can choose to centre the map on his or her current location, e.g., with a standard
    button.
    - The user can zoom and pan the map freely.
    - When returning to the app, the map shows the same region it was showing when the app was
    paused or closed (even if the app is terminated and relaunched).
    -The map is made to show default location on start.
    -Application requests for location permissions on start.

## Known Limitation
    
    - Markers are not scalable according to the zoom factor.
    - I was Not able to hold-on onRequestPermissionResult until permissions are given or rejected by user. 
    - Location Permission is a MUST requirement devoid of which app wont work.
    - If GPS is not enabled when asked for, centering marker button would be disabled (as it works with that).
